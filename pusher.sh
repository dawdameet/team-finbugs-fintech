  -t "Bug 1: Incorrect VADER Sentiment Threshold" \
  -b "## Bug Description
The sentiment analysis is heavily skewed towards 'neutral'. Even clearly positive headlines (e.g., 'stock surges') are classified as neutral. This results in an inaccurate VADER distribution and a 'neutral' overall sentiment, even when the news is good.

## Expected Behavior
Positive headlines should be classified as 'positive' with appropriate VADER compound scores. The threshold for positive sentiment should correctly identify bullish news.

## Current Behavior
Headlines with positive sentiment are being classified as neutral. The VADER distribution shows an overwhelming majority of 'neutral' classifications even for clearly positive/negative news.

## Files Affected
\`market_sentiment/sentiment_analyzer.py\`

## Difficulty: EASY **Points: 10**

## Reproduction Steps
1. Run the sentiment analyzer on sample headlines
2. Observe that positive headlines are classified as neutral
3. Check the VADER compound score threshold in analyze_text_vader method
4. Identify that the positive threshold is set incorrectly
5. Adjust the threshold to match VADER's standard thresholds

## Solution
Change 'if compound >= 0.5:' to 'if compound >= 0.05:'

## Hints
Look at in the analyze_text_vader method

  -b "## Bug Description
The word cloud and 'Top 10 Keywords' list show only common English stop words like 'and', 'the', 'for', 'is', etc., instead of relevant financial terms. The keyword extraction is completely broken.

## Expected Behavior
Keywords should be meaningful financial and domain-specific terms like 'stock', 'earnings', 'revenue', 'market', etc. Stop words should be filtered out.

## Current Behavior
The keyword list and word cloud contain only stop words (and, the, for, is, of, to). All meaningful words are being removed.

## Files Affected
\`market_sentiment/sentiment_analyzer.py\`

## Difficulty: MEDIUM **Points: 20**

## Reproduction Steps
1. Run the sentiment analyzer and examine the word cloud
2. Notice that only stop words appear in the word cloud
3. Check the Top 10 Keywords output
4. Examine the extract_keywords method
5. Look at the list comprehension that filters words
6. Identify that the filter logic is reversed

## Solution
Change 'all_words.extend([w for w in words if w in stop_words and len(w) > 3])' to 'all_words.extend([w for w in words if w not in stop_words and len(w) > 3])'

## Hints

The word cloud shows malformed, jumbled 'words' that are actually multiple words concatenated together (e.g., 'teslastocksurgesonrecord...'). The Top 10 Keywords list is empty or shows these same jumbled strings.

## Expected Behavior
Words should be properly separated and individual. The regex should clean special characters while preserving word boundaries.

## Current Behavior
All spaces are being removed from text, causing all words in a headline to be mashed together into one giant string.

## Files Affected

## Difficulty: HARD **Points: 30**

## Reproduction Steps
1. Run the analyzer and observe jumbled words in the word cloud
2. Examine the clean_text method
3. Look at the regex pattern being used
4. Identify that the pattern removes ALL non-letter characters
5. Realize that spaces are non-letter characters and are being removed
6. Modify the regex to preserve whitespace

## Solution
Change 'text = re.sub(r'[^A-Za-z]', '', text)' to 'text = re.sub(r'[^A-Za-z\\\\s]', '', text)'

## Hints
The pattern should be r'[^A-Za-z\\\\s]' to keep letters AND spaces

The Yahoo News analysis shows every single headline as identical - just N copies of the last headline fetched. The entire news DataFrame and subsequent analysis is worthless because it's analyzing one headline 50 times.

## Expected Behavior
Each row in the news DataFrame should contain a different headline from the Yahoo Finance API.

## Current Behavior
All headlines in the DataFrame are identical, showing only the last headline fetched from the API repeated multiple times.

1. Run the analyzer and examine the news DataFrame output

4. Find where headlines list is built in the loop
5. Look for any code after the loop that modifies the headlines list
6. Identify the line that overwrites the entire list
7. Remove the problematic line

## Solution

The Value at Risk (VaR) calculation uses the wrong percentile. For 95% confidence VaR, it should use the 5th percentile (bottom 5%), but the code uses the 95th percentile (top 5%), giving completely opposite risk estimates.

## Expected Behavior
VaR at 95% confidence should show the 5th percentile loss (the threshold where 5% of outcomes are worse).

## Current Behavior
The code calculates the 95th percentile instead of the 5th percentile, showing best-case scenarios instead of worst-case risk.

## Solution
Change 'np.percentile(returns, 95)' to 'np.percentile(returns, 5)'

The correlation matrix is calculated along the wrong axis, producing a time-series correlation instead of asset correlation. The matrix dimensions are wrong and the correlations are meaningless.

## Expected Behavior
Correlation should be calculated across time for each pair of assets (axis=0).

## Current Behavior
The code uses axis=1, calculating correlation across assets for each time point, which is nonsensical.

5. Identify that axis=1 is used instead of axis=0

## Solution
Change '.corr(axis=1)' to '.corr(axis=0)' or just '.corr()' (default is axis=0)

## Hints
Correlation should be calculated down the time axis (axis=0), not across assets.

  -b "## Bug Description
The Sharpe ratio is calculated using daily returns but reported as if it were annualized. The values are too low by a factor of sqrt(252).

## Expected Behavior
Sharpe ratio should be annualized: multiply by sqrt(252) for daily data or sqrt(12) for monthly data.

## Current Behavior
The code calculates Sharpe from daily returns without annualizing, making all Sharpe ratios appear artificially low.
